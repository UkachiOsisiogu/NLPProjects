### Title: Semantic Sentiment Analysis using Probabilistic Graphical Models 

### Abstract 

The use of semantics to capture the sentiment of users is a play a vital role in the industry, as this would ensure that meanings are not misconstrued. However, in capturing semantics there are certain considerations to be made. These considerations ensure that the performance of semantic sentiment analysis is carried out properly to avoid prevalent misclassification. Researchers have proposed various algorithms to capture semantics. However, little work has been carried out on how best probabilistic graphical models can capture the semantics of a sentence and then classify the sentence. This calls for more investigation as the existing methods of semantic sentiment analysis tend to be overconfident and may not perform well in areas where there is little change in data. In this project we developed two probabilistic graphical models â€“ Bayesian Networks and Hidden Markov Models and made some comparisons. Datasets used were obtained from Tweeter because of the peculiar structure they have. We also exploited the ability for these models to capture dependencies to perform reasonable classifications giving us reasonable results.
